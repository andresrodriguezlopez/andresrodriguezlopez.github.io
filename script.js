   PROJECT DATA
   -> Edit this array to add / remove / change projects.
   -> category must match the buttons' data-filter values:
      "vfx-shader" | "technical-artist" | "3d-modeling" | "videogames" | "programming"
   -> thumb: path to the card's cover image (e.g. "img/flamethrower.jpg").
      Leave it as "" to show a text placeholder instead.
   -> desc: overall project description (shown once, below the viewer).
      Supports HTML — wrap paragraphs in <p> tags for multi-paragraph
      descriptions, and use <strong>, <ul>/<li>, etc. as needed.
      Example: "<p>First paragraph.</p><p>Second paragraph with <strong>bold</strong>.</p>"
   -> media: ORDERED list of everything shown when the project opens —
      mix videos and photos freely, in any order, and give EACH ONE
      its own caption explaining what you did in that specific clip/shot.
      Two item types:
        { type: "video", src: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID", caption: "..." }
        { type: "image", src: "img/yourphoto.jpg",                      caption: "..." }
      Videos can also be local files (e.g. "videos/clip.mp4") — they get
      native <video> playback with sound, instead of an iframe embed.
      The first item in the array is what opens by default.
      Leave media: [] if you don't have anything uploaded yet — the
      project will still open showing just the title and description.

  desc: `
    <p>A procedural system built with Unreal Engine's PCG that generates a layer of
    organic corruption on any mesh you pick from the Content Browser. It samples points
    across that base mesh's surface (sculpted in Houdini) and instances spheres ("eggs")
    with random rotation and scale, controlling how much they overlap.</p>
    <p>The veins connecting the corruption to the environment use pathfinding instead
    of straight lines, with secondary branches coming off the main veins. A World Raycast
    detects nearby walls and surfaces so veins can also spread across vertical geometry,
    not just the ground.</p>
    <p>The material is a triplanar master material with subsurface scattering, built
    from a texture made in Substance Designer, with three instances (veins, eggs, main
    mesh) adjustable separately. The eggs have a World Position Offset driving a
    heartbeat-style pulse — each one calculates its own rhythm from its bounding box,
    so they pulse asynchronously.</p>
    <p>A dynamic mesh fills the gaps between eggs and veins to make the whole thing
    feel more solid. The whole system is parametrized (vein count, branch density,
    scale) so it can be tuned without touching the graph.</p>

    years — started in 3rd year and completed in 4th year of the degree. The final
    result is a <strong>vertical slice</strong> of the game.</p>

    <p><strong>My role covered several disciplines:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Environment Art</strong><br>
    Modeling and texturing of the playable scenario (not including props),
    plus scene lighting.</p>

    <p><strong>Character Programming</strong><br>
    Movement, melee combat with a 3-hit sword combo, interactive projectiles
    that react with switches and enemies, dash mechanics, UI and menu implementation,
    several game managers (game state, combat), and a
    Sound Manager implemented with FMOD.</p>

    <p><strong>Enemy AI & Systems</strong><br>
    Full enemy programming, including a target-lock system for combat.
    Animations were integrated using a 9-directional Blend Tree
    to drive locomotion relative to the locked target.</p>

    <p><strong>VFX</strong><br>
    Particle effects for combat, abilities and environmental feedback.</p>
